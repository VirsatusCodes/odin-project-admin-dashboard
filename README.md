Where i attempt to recreate The Odin Projects layout and design.

I did a mixture of clickable text and images and non-clickable, and copied the general layout
and trends of the provided image its not particularly beautiful but it shows i can accomplish the layout. its relatively responsive and would be able to easily add more projects to it. that being said after completing the project there is ALOT i would have changed or done differently, i would want a better understanding of what i want the minimum sizes and maximum sizes of items to be, i would have seperated projects and announcements/trending with my initial grid on the container, one of my big issues with these assignments is how vague they are, i go for the assigned goals even though it gives you the option of adding your own spin because i want to make use of and learn my tools and move on.

Another big thing i learned this one is i spent a few minutes thinking about my html and just went ham but next time with a project that has so much nesting and information to place i should spend more time, and plan my nesting a bit more/better. here i under classed some places, i over ID'd some (though maybe not cuz it would have been useful if i were using java or linking them to actual places) and i over classed other locations,  it was a nice project though, let me try out alot of the css selectors i used and appreciate them more, css selecterors has its benefits and detriments, it lets you be more vague with your selectors but when editing code in the future or adding/removing content it can definitely screw up your styling, something to keep in mind.

overall a fun little project where i got to tryout doing alot of little things and think about web page design and implementation alot more, learned a decent amount and had a good time.
